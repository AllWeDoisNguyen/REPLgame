# The Sassy Riddler REPL game

User must have figlet installed on their terminal. 

The Sassy Riddler is a REPL game that takes a player through a series of riddles and sassy comments based on the user's choices. Players are encouraged to answer with responses that would normally end a game. Feel free to say 'no' and ask for as many hints as you need. 

The code showcases methods and loops learned after only a week of studying the Ruby language.
